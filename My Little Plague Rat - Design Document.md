# My Little Plague Rat - Design Document
 
## Synopsis
 
My Little Plague Rat is a mission based virtual pet game where the player controls and strengthens plague rats to meet the goals of their community. By caring for and nurturing the rats, they become stronger and more effective. Together, the community you cultivate can "rise up" to meet any challenge.
 
## Gameplay
 
The core gameplay loop is about setting up your rats for success, then sending them on missions.
 
### Raising Your Rat
 
You can buff your rats in the following ways:
 
- Feed them food (Stamina Bar)
- Play minigames with the rat to increase stats
  - Cunning - ability to avoid danger
  - Athleticism - ability to fight danger
  - Cuteness - ability to approach humans
- Equip them with items (Additional Abilities)
 p
These three methods will improve a stat bar for each rat (shown above in parentheses). The power rating is a separate number, as it starts at 0 and goes up as the player equips them with items. The food bar adds additional base power, while the happiness rating multiplies it by some amount (TBD).
 
### Plague Missions
 
Sending your rats out on missions is how you gain rewards (equipment, stat increases) to further improve your rat's abilities. Missions are selected from a mission select menu and the risk/rewards are displayed (with a potential for a bonus reward). A mission can cost one plague rat or more, and you can only run a mission if you have the appropriate amount of rats. Missions finish rather quickly (this isn't a mobile game), and are given a little animation/message to show success/failure, along with a description of any bonus reward. If a mission went incredibly poorly, it is possible for a rat to perish on the mission. This is more likely if the rat is sent out with poor equipment, low food bar, or low happiness bar.

-	Difficult missions could be:
- Hard missions could be sending them to different towns/countries on caravans or ships. They would bring back “exotic” or super powerful items or items needed for the final boss mission.
 
### Winning
 
There will be a final "grand" plague mission that the player can engage in. It will be made clear that this is the final mission, and to make sure that your rats are ready for the challenge ahead. Ultimately, the goal is for this mission to appear after so many missions have been completed, or potentially after several difficult missions  have been defeated.
